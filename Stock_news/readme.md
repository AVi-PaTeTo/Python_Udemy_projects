a simple code the sends notification about your desired stock prices and related news article

can be set up on an online server so that it checks the stock prices daily and send a notification,
goal was to send a message if there was a certaing percentage (5%) change in closing prices of yesterday and the day before yesterday 
when i was working on the code, the tesla stock prices changes were less than (5%), so i change up a few lines
now it will send a daily message with the change in price and 3 news article related to the company


just a note:
wrote this at: 
9pm of 28th april
and the stock api data started from 26th april and below, therefore the "yesterday" and "day_before" are set that way
