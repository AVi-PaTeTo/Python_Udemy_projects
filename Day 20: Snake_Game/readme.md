the classic snake game

incomplete: ~~need to add collision~~, ~~add some sort of score~~

everything seems to be working fine but i haven't tested the end stages of the game, i am leaving it like this for now

known bug: pressing 2 direction button fast enough can make you do a 180 turn, thus ending the game
